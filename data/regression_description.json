Data collected from [baseball-reference.com](baseball-reference.com)  \n\n**Please cite**:   \n\n\n\n**Moneyball**  \n\nIn the early 2000s, Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta worked for the Oakland Athletics. While there, they literally changed the game of baseball. They didn't do it using a bat or glove, and they certainly didn't do it by throwing money at the issue; in fact, money was the issue. They didn't have enough of it, but they were still expected to keep up with teams that had much deeper pockets. This is where Statistics came riding down the hillside on a white horse to save the day. This data set contains some of the information that was available to Beane and DePodesta in the early 2000s, and it can be used to better understand their methods.\n\n\n\n### Attributes  \n\nThis data set contains a set of variables that Beane and DePodesta focused heavily on. They determined that stats like on-base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG) were very important when it came to scoring runs, however they were largely undervalued by most scouts at the time. This translated to a gold mine for Beane and DePodesta. Since these players weren't being looked at by other teams, they could recruit these players on a small budget. The variables are as follows:\n\n\n\nTeam  \n\nLeague  \n\nYear  \n\nRuns Scored (RS)  \n\nRuns Allowed (RA)  \n\nWins (W)  \n\nOn-Base Percentage (OBP)  \n\nSlugging Percentage (SLG)  \n\nBatting Average (BA)  \n\nPlayoffs (binary)  \n\nRankSeason  \n\nRankPlayoffs  \n\nGames Played (G)  \n\nOpponent On-Base Percentage (OOBP)  \n\nOpponent Slugging Percentage (OSLG)  \n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements  \n\nThis data set is referenced in The Analytics Edge course on EdX during the lecture regarding the story of Moneyball.

Sports-reference.com is one of the most comprehensive sports statistics resource available, and I highly recommend checking it out.\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\nIt is such an important skill in today's world to be able to see the \"truth\" in a data set. That is what DePodesta was able to do with this data, and it unsettled the entire system of baseball recruitment. Beane and DePodesta defined their season goal as making it to playoffs. With that in mind, consider these questions:\n\n\n\nHow does a team make the playoffs?\n\nHow does a team win more games?\n\nHow does a team score more runs?\n\nThey are all simple questions with simple answers, but now it is time to use the data to find the \"truth\" hidden in the numbers.", "diamonds": "This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds.

Banking is no exception.\n\nThe digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner... and often before they've even realized they need the service. In their 3rd Kaggle competition, Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before.\n\nIn this competition, Santander Group is asking Kagglers to help them identify the value of transactions for each potential customer.

These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium car makers. Daimler's Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.\n\nTo ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler's engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Daimler's production lines.\n\nIn this competition, Daimler is challenging Kagglers to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler's standards.\n\nThis dataset contains an anonymized set of variables, each representing a custom feature in a Mercedes car.

In the field phase a viticultural\nexperiment was conducted to investigate the differences between 4\ntypes of trellising and 2 methods of pruning.  The design was a\nsplit-plot design in which the trellis types were assigned to the main\nplots using two adjacent Youden squares of 3 rows and 4 columns.  Each\nmain plot was split into two subplots (or halfplots) and the methods\nof pruning assigned at random independently to the two halfplots in\neach main plot.  The produce of each halfplot was made into a wine so\nthat there were 24 wines altogether.\nThe second phase was an evaluation phase in which the produce from the\nhalplots was evaluated by 6 judges all of whom took part in 24\nsittings.  In the first 12 sittings the judges evaluated the wines\nmade from the halfplots of one square; the final 12 sittings were to\nevaluate the wines from the other square.  At each sitting, each judge\nassessed two glasses of wine from each of the halplots of one of the\nmain plots.  The main plots allocated to the judges at each sitting\nwere determined as follows.  For the allocation of rows, each occasion\nwas subdivided into 3 intervals of 4 consecutive sittings.  During\neach interval, each judge examined plots from one particular row,\nthese being determined using two 3x3 Latin squares for each occasion,\none for judges 1-3 and the other for judges 4-6.  At each sitting\njudges 1-3 examined wines from one particular column and judges 4-6\nexamined wines from another column.  The columns were randomized to\nthe 2 sets of judges x 3 intervals x 4 sittings using duplicates of a\nbalanced incomplete block design for v=4 and k=2 that were latinized.\nThis balanced incomplete block design consists of three sets of 2\nblocks, each set containing the 4 \"treatments\".  For each interval, a\ndifferent set of 2 blocks was taken and each block assigned to two\nsittings, but with the columns within the block placed in reverse\norder in one sitting compared to the other sitting.  Thus, in each\ninterval, a judge would evaluate a wine from each of the 4 columns.\nThe scores assigned in evaluating the wines, and the factors indexing\nthem, are given below.

More details on how to use the data\n\nThe data are made available as a benchmark for regression models. In order\nto compare models, it is practical to use the data set as follows:\n\nC and M combined are used to tune (estimate, train) the model. (Some\napproaches set aside some training data to control overfitting. These data\nshould be a subset of C+M. In (1) the subset M was used for this purpose.)\n\nT is used to test the model once it has been tuned.\nIf each model has an element of randomness (as is the case\nfor neural networks) the most reliable measure of performance of a single\nmodel is obtained by selecting a handful of models on the basis of C+M and\nquoting the average of the performances on T.\nIn the presence of randomness it is bad practice to train a lot of models\non C+M and then select the best of these on the basis of T.\n\nC, M and T are drawn from the same pool of data, so T is used to test the\nability of the models to interpolate. The data sets E1 and E2 contain\nmore fat and protein respectively and are intended to be used to test the\nability of the models to extrapolate.\n\n\n4. Performance of neural network models\n\nThe performance is measured as Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) which\nis the root mean square of the difference between the true and the predicted\ncontent.\n\nFor the prediction of fat on the data set T the following results were obtained\n\nReference SEP   method (see the papers for details)\n(1)       0.65  10-6-1 network, early stopping\n(2)       0.52  10-3-1 network, Bayesian\n(3)       0.36  13-X-1 network, Bayesian, Automatic Relevance Determination\n\nA linear model with 10 inputs yields SEP=2.78.\n\n5.

ISSN: 0167-9236.\n\nIn the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.\nThe inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T), etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure).\n \n4. Relevant Information:\nThe two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables  are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\nThese datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.\nThe classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. \n\n5. Number of Instances: red wine - first 1599 instances; white wine - instances 1600 to 6497. \n \n6.

The age of\n    abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it,\n    and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and\n    time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are\n    used to predict the age.

However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA. Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range 0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. \nAttributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population \nattribute has a mean value of 0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value. The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to 0.00)).\n\nHowever, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)\nA limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.", "pol": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown -   \n**Please cite**:   \n\nThis is a commercial application described in Weiss & Indurkhya (1995). \n The data describes a telecommunication problem.
