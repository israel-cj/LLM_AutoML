The KDD Cup 2009 offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling).\nThe most practical way, in a CRM system, to build knowledge on customer is to produce scores. A score (the output of a model) is an evaluation for all instances of a target variable to explain (i.e. churn, appetency or up-selling). Tools which produce scores allow to project, on a given population, quantifiable information. The score is computed using input variables which describe instances. Scores are then used by the information system (IS), for example, to personalize the customer relationship. An industrial customer analysis platform able to build prediction models with a very large number of input variables has been developed by Orange Labs. This platform implements several processing methods for instances and variables selection, prediction and indexation based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging method. The main characteristic of this platform is its ability to scale on very large datasets with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of variables. The rapid and robust detection of the variables that have most contributed to the output prediction can be a key factor in a marketing application.\nAppetency: In our context, the appetency is the propensity to buy a service or a product.\nThe training set contains 50,000 examples.\nThe first predictive 190 variables are numerical and the last 40 predictive variables are categorical.\nThe last target variable is binary {-1,1}.", "covertype": "**Author**: Jock A. Blackard, Dr. Denis J. Dean, Dr. Charles W. Anderson  \n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype) - 1998  \n\nThis is the original version of the famous covertype dataset in ARFF format. \n\n**Covertype**  \nPredicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System &#40;RIS&#41; data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types). \n\nThis study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices. \n\nSome background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value. \n\nAs for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4). \n\nThe Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.) Cache la Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low elevation range and species composition.\n\nAttribute Information:  \nGiven is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The forest cover type is the classification problem.

Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. The phonemes are transcribed as follows: sh as in she, dcl as in dark, iy as the vowel in she, aa as the vowel in dark, and ao as the first vowel in water.  \n\n### Source\n\nThe current dataset was formatted by the KEEL repository, but originally hosted by the [ELENA Project](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/neural-nets/Research/Projects/ELENA/elena.htm#stuff). The dataset originates from the European ESPRIT 5516 project: ROARS. The aim of this project was the development and the implementation of a real time analytical system for French and Spanish speech recognition.  \n\n### Relevant information\n\nMost of the already existing speech recognition systems are global systems (typically Hidden Markov Models and Time Delay Neural Networks) which recognizes signals and do not really use the speech\nspecificities.  On the contrary, analytical systems take into account the articulatory process leading to the different phonemes of a given language, the idea being to deduce the presence of each of the\nphonetic features from the acoustic observation.\n\nThe main difficulty of analytical systems is to obtain acoustical parameters sufficiantly reliable. These acoustical measurements must :\n\n   - contain all the information relative to the concerned phonetic feature.\n   - being speaker independent.\n   - being context independent.\n   - being more or less robust to noise.\n\nThe primary acoustical observation is always voluminous (spectrum x N different observation moments) and classification cannot been processed directly.\n\nIn ROARS, the initial database is provided by cochlear spectra, which may be seen as the output of a filters bank having a constant DeltaF/F0, where the central frequencies are distributed on a\nlogarithmic scale (MEL type) to simulate the frequency answer of the auditory nerves.  The filters outputs are taken every 2 or 8 msec (integration on 4 or 16 msec) depending on the type of phoneme\nobserved (stationary or transitory).  \n\nThe aim of the present database is to distinguish between nasal and\noral vowels. There are thus two different classes:\n\n- Class 0 : Nasals  \n- Class 1 : Orals        \n\nThis database contains vowels coming from 1809 isolated syllables (for example: pa, ta, pan,...). Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. Each harmonic is signed: positive when it corresponds to a local maximum of the spectrum and negative otherwise.\n\nThree observation moments have been kept for each vowel to obtain 5427 different instances: \n\n - the observation corresponding to the maximum total energy Ene. \n   \n - the observations taken 8 msec before and 8 msec after the observation corresponding to this maximum total energy.\n\nFrom these 5427 initial values, 23 instances for which the amplitude of the 5 first harmonics was zero were removed, leading to the 5404 instances of the present database. The patterns are presented in a random order.\n\n### Past Usage  \n\nAlinat, P., Periodic Progress Report 4, ROARS Project ESPRIT II- Number 5516, February 1993, Thomson report TS.

Your challenge is to create the \"perfect black box\" eliminating the human in the loop.\n\nThis is a challenge with code submission: your code will be executed automatically on our servers to train and test your learning machines with unknown datasets. However, there is NO OBLIGATION TO SUBMIT CODE. Half of the prizes can be won by just submitting prediction results. There are six rounds (Prep, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, and Master) in which datasets of progressive difficulty are introduced (5 per round). There is NO PREREQUISITE TO PARTICIPATE IN PREVIOUS ROUNDS to enter a new round. The rounds alternate AutoML phases in which submitted code is \"blind tested\" in limited time on our platform, using datasets you have never seen before, and Tweakathon phases giving you time to improve your methods by tweaking them on those datasets and running them on your own systems (without computational resource limitation).\n\nNOTE: This dataset corresponds to one of the datasets of the challenge.", "albert": "The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to real world datasets of interest to 4Paradigm.

It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd.\n\n         The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing\n\n         3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of\n\n         shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects.\n\n         Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes\n\n         of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class-\n\n         ification rule tree by means of computer induction.\n\n          This object recognition strategy was successfully used to \n\n         discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses\n\n         viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\n\n          The rule tree classification performance compared favourably\n\n         to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neigh-\n\n         bour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and\n\n         computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees\n\n         generated by example indicated that the tree structure was \n\n         heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped\n\n         similar object views into single decisions.\n\n \n\n DESCRIPTION\n\n          The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS\n\n         (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which \n\n         extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising\n\n         both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance,\n\n         skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic\n\n         measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and\n\n         compactness.\n\n          Four \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment:\n\n         a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.\n\n         This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the \n\n         expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would\n\n         be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to\n\n         distinguish between the cars.\n\n          The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the\n\n         model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees\n\n         to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse\n\n         backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black\n\n         to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000\n\n         framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with\n\n         a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels.\n\n         These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes,\n\n         negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and\n\n         thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to\n\n         remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\n\n          The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured\n\n         using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees\n\n         corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and\n\n         270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of\n\n         60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured\n\n         for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between \n\n         images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\n\n          A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera \n\n         at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets\n\n         also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains\n\n         only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image\n\n         at some orientations.\n\n \n\n ATTRIBUTES\n\n         \n\n         COMPACTNESS     (average perim)**2/area\n\n         \n\n         CIRCULARITY     (average radius)**2/area\n\n         \n\n         DISTANCE CIRCULARITY    area/(av.distance from border)**2\n\n         \n\n         RADIUS RATIO    (max.rad-min.rad)/av.radius\n\n         \n\n         PR.AXIS ASPECT RATIO    (minor axis)/(major axis)\n\n         \n\n         MAX.LENGTH ASPECT RATIO (length perp. max length)/(max length)\n\n         \n\n         SCATTER RATIO   (inertia about minor axis)/(inertia about major axis)\n\n         \n\n         ELONGATEDNESS           area/(shrink width)**2\n\n         \n\n         PR.AXIS RECTANGULARITY  area/(pr.axis length*pr.axis width)\n\n         \n\n         MAX.LENGTH RECTANGULARITY area/(max.length*length perp. to this)\n\n         \n\n         SCALED VARIANCE         (2nd order moment about minor axis)/area\n\n         ALONG MAJOR AXIS\n\n         \n\n         SCALED VARIANCE         (2nd order moment about major axis)/area\n\n         ALONG MINOR AXIS \n\n         \n\n         SCALED RADIUS OF GYRATION       (mavar+mivar)/area\n\n         \n\n         SKEWNESS ABOUT  (3rd order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**3\n\n         MAJOR AXIS\n\n         \n\n         SKEWNESS ABOUT  (3rd order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**3\n\n         MINOR AXIS\n\n                 \n\n         KURTOSIS ABOUT  (4th order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**4\n\n         MINOR AXIS  \n\n                 \n\n         KURTOSIS ABOUT  (4th order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**4\n\n         MAJOR AXIS\n\n         \n\n         HOLLOWS RATIO   (area of hollows)/(area of bounding polygon)\n\n         \n\n          Where sigma_maj**2 is the variance along the major axis and\n\n         sigma_min**2 is the variance along the minor axis, and\n\n         \n\n         area of hollows= area of bounding poly-area of object \n\n         \n\n          The area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of\n\n         the computation to find the maximum length.

Each species was represented by 11 to 60 mass spectra obtained from 7 to 20 bacterial strains, constituting altogether a dataset of 571 spectra obtained from 213 strains. The spectra were obtained according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine in which the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for 24 to 48 hours before a portion of the colony was picked, spotted on a MALDI slide and a mass spectrum was acquired. \n\n\n\nb) Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. For that purpose we considered 10 pairs of species of various taxonomic proximity:\n\n* 4 mixtures, labeled A, B, C and D, involved species that belong to the same genus,  \n\n* 2 mixtures, labeled E and F, involved species that belong to distinct genera, but to the same Gram type,  \n\n* 4 mixtures, labeled G, H, I and J, involved species that belong to distinct Gram types.  \n\nEach mixture was represented by 2 pairs of strains, which were mixed according to the following 9 concentration ratios : 1:0, 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 0:1. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each couple of strains, leading altogether to a dataset of 360 spectra, among which 80 are actually pure sample spectra.\n\n\n\n### Relevant Papers\n\n\n\nMah\u00e9 et al.

The raw data is still available on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+(Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences)).\n\n\n\nThe data consists of 3,186 data points (splice junctions). The data points are described by 180 indicator binary variables and the problem is to recognize the 3 classes (ei, ie, neither), i.e., the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). The StatLog DNA dataset is a processed version of the [Irvine database]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+(Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences))). The main difference is that the symbolic variables representing the nucleotides (only A,G,T,C) were replaced by 3 binary indicator variables. Thus the original 60 symbolic attributes were changed into 180 binary attributes. The names of the examples were removed. The examples with ambiguities were removed (there was very few of them, 4). The StatLog version of this dataset was produced by Ross King at Strathclyde University. For original details see the Irvine database documentation.\n\n\n\nThe nucleotides A,C,G,T were given indicator values as follows:\n\nA -> 1 0 0\n\nC -> 0 1 0\n\nG -> 0 0 1\n\nT -> 0 0 0\n\n\n\nHint: Much better performance is generally observed if attributes closest to the junction are used.

Title: Wine Quality \n\n2. Sources\n   Created by: Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) @ 2009\n   \n3. Past Usage:\n\n  P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. \n  Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.\n  In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553. ISSN: 0167-9236.\n\n  In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.\n  The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data\n  (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality \n  between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model\n  these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the\n  best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T),\n  etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity\n  analysis procedure).\n \n4. Relevant Information:\n\n   The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese &quot;Vinho Verde&quot; wine.\n   For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].\n   Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables \n   are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\n\n   These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.\n   The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than\n   excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent\n   or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So\n   it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. \n\n5. Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. \n\n6. Number of Attributes: 11 + output attribute\n  \n   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of\n   feature selection.\n\n7.

Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time. \n\nThe data is used to create an algorithm capable of learning from this historical data to predict approval/denial for an unseen set of employees.\n\n\n\n### Dataset Information\n\n\n\nWhen an employee at any company starts work, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. This access may allow an employee to read/manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work (e.g. not able to log into a reporting portal). A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the needed access in order to overcome access obstacles. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a non-trivial amount of time and money.\n\n\n\nThere is a considerable amount of data regarding an employee&rsquo;s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.\n\n\n\nThe original training and test set were merged.\n\n\n\n### Attributes Information\n\n\n\n* ACTION [target]: ACTION is 1 if the resource was approved, 0 if the resource was not  \n\n* RESOURCE: An ID for each resource  \n\n* MGR_ID: The EMPLOYEE ID of the manager of the current EMPLOYEE ID record; an employee may have only one manager at a time  \n\n* ROLE_ROLLUP_1: Company role grouping category id 1 (e.g. US Engineering)  \n\n* ROLE_ROLLUP_2: Company role grouping category id 2 (e.g. US Retail)  \n\n* ROLE_DEPTNAME: Company role department description (e.g. Retail)  \n\n* ROLE_TITLE: Company role business title description (e.g. Senior Engineering Retail Manager)  \n\n* ROLE_FAMILY_DESC: Company role family extended description (e.g. Retail Manager, Software Engineering)  \n\n* ROLE_FAMILY: Company role family description (e.g. Retail Manager)  \n\n* ROLE_CODE: Company role code; this code is unique to each role (e.g. Manager)", "nomao": "**Author**: Nomao Labs\n\n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Nomao)\n\n**Please cite**: Laurent Candillier and Vincent Lemaire.

This similarity-statement is not transferable across the 51 different states.\n\nDescription from the donor of the database: \n\nThe weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau. We use 3 sets of controls. These are:\n1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.\n2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.\n3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.\n\nWe use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and \"rake\" through them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating \"weighted tallies\" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.\n\n\n### Relevant papers  \n\nRonny Kohavi and Barry Becker.

We are making available 30 datasets, all pre-formatted in given feature representations (this means that each example consists of a fixed number of numerical coefficients). The challenge is to solve classification and regression problems, without any further human intervention.\n\nThe difficulty is that there is a broad diversity of data types and distributions (including balanced or unbalanced classes, sparse or dense feature representations, with or without missing values or categorical variables, various metrics of evaluation, various proportions of number of features and number of examples). The problems are drawn from a wide variety of domains and include medical diagnosis from laboratory analyses, speech recognition, credit rating, prediction or drug toxicity or efficacy, classification of text, prediction of customer satisfaction, object recognition, protein structure prediction, action recognition in video data, etc. While there exist machine learning toolkits including methods that can solve all these problems, it is still considerable human effort to find, for a given combination of dataset, task, metric of evaluation, and available computational time, the combination of methods and hyper-parameter setting that is best suited. Your challenge is to create the \"perfect black box\" eliminating the human in the loop.\n\nThis is a challenge with code submission: your code will be executed automatically on our servers to train and test your learning machines with unknown datasets. However, there is NO OBLIGATION TO SUBMIT CODE. Half of the prizes can be won by just submitting prediction results.

The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between \"bad\" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and \"good\" normal connections.\nThe 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program was prepared and managed by MIT Lincoln Labs. The objective was to survey and evaluate research in intrusion detection.  A standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment, was provided.  The 1999 KDD intrusion detection contest uses a version of this dataset.\n\nLincoln Labs set up an environment to acquire nine weeks of raw TCP dump data for a local-area network (LAN) simulating a typical U.S. Air Force LAN.  They operated the LAN as if it were a true Air Force environment, but peppered it with multiple attacks.\n\nThe raw training data was about four gigabytes of compressed binary TCP dump data from seven weeks of network traffic.  This was processed into about five million connection records.  Similarly, the two weeks of test data yielded around two million connection records.\n\nA connection is a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at some well defined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP address to a target IP address under some well defined protocol.  Each connection is labeled as either normal, or as an attack, with exactly one specific attack type.  Each connection record consists of about 100 bytes.\n\nAttacks fall into four main categories:\n\n* DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;\n* R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password;\n* U2R:  unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various \"buffer overflow\" attacks;\n* probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning.\nIt is important to note that the test data is not from the same probability distribution as the training data, and it includes specific attack types not in the training data.  This makes the task more realistic.  Some intrusion experts believe that most novel attacks are variants of known attacks and the \"signature\" of known attacks can be sufficient to catch novel variants.  The datasets contain a total of 24 training attack types, with an additional 14 types in the test data only. \n  \n \nDERIVED FEATURES\n\nStolfo et al. defined higher-level features that help in distinguishing normal connections from attacks.  There are several categories of derived features.\nThe \"same host\" features examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same destination host as the current connection, and calculate statistics related to protocol behavior, service, etc.\n\nThe similar \"same service\" features examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same service as the current connection.\n\n\"Same host\" and \"same service\" features are together called  time-based traffic features of the connection records.\n\nSome probing attacks scan the hosts (or ports) using a much larger time interval than two seconds, for example once per minute.  Therefore, connection records were also sorted by destination host, and features were constructed using a window of 100 connections to the same host instead of a time window.  This yields a set of so-called host-based traffic features.\n\nUnlike most of the DOS and probing attacks, there appear to be no sequential patterns that are frequent in records of R2L and U2R attacks. This is because the DOS and probing attacks involve many connections to some host(s) in a very short period of time, but the R2L and U2R attacks are embedded in the data portions \nof packets, and normally involve only a single connection.\n\nUseful algorithms for mining the unstructured data portions of packets automatically are an open research question.  Stolfo et al. used domain knowledge to add features that look for suspicious behavior in the data portions, such as the number of failed login attempts.  These features are called \"content\" features.\n\nA complete listing of the set of features defined for the connection records is given in the three tables below.

The KDD Cup 2009 offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling).\n\nThe most practical way, in a CRM system, to build knowledge on customer is to produce scores. A score (the output of a model) is an evaluation for all instances of a target variable to explain (i.e. churn, appetency or up-selling). Tools which produce scores allow to project, on a given population, quantifiable information. The score is computed using input variables which describe instances. Scores are then used by the information system (IS), for example, to personalize the customer relationship. An industrial customer analysis platform able to build prediction models with a very large number of input variables has been developed by Orange Labs. This platform implements several processing methods for instances and variables selection, prediction and indexation based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging method. The main characteristic of this platform is its ability to scale on very large datasets with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of variables. The rapid and robust detection of the variables that have most contributed to the output prediction can be a key factor in a marketing application.\n\nThe challenge is to beat the in-house system developed by Orange Labs. It is an opportunity to prove that you can deal with a very large database, including heterogeneous noisy data (numerical and categorical variables), and unbalanced class distributions. Time efficiency is often a crucial point. Therefore part of the competition will be time-constrained to test the ability of the participants to deliver solutions quickly.\n\n**Task Description**\n\nThe task is to estimate the churn, appetency and up-selling probability of customers, hence there are three target values to be predicted. The challenge is staged in phases to test the rapidity with which each team is able to produce results. A large number of variables (15,000) is made available for prediction. However, to engage participants having access to less computing power, a smaller version of the dataset with only 230 variables will be made available in the second part of the challenge.\n\n* Churn (wikipedia definition): Churn rate is also sometimes called attrition rate. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support. In its broadest sense, churn rate is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving into or out of a collection over a specific period of time. The term is used in many contexts, but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base. For instance, it is an important factor for any business with a subscriber-based service model, including mobile telephone networks and pay TV operators. The term is also used to refer to participant turnover in peer-to-peer networks.\n\n* Appetency: In our context, the appetency is the propensity to buy a service or a product.\n\n* Up-selling (wikipedia definition): Up-selling is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the customer purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. Up-selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, but up-selling can also be simply exposing the customer to other options he or she may not have considered previously. Up-selling can imply selling something additional, or selling something that is more profitable or otherwise preferable for the seller instead of the original sale.\n\nThe training set contains 50,000 examples. The first predictive 14,740 variables are numerical and the last 260 predictive variables are categorical. The last target variable is binary (-1,1)."}
